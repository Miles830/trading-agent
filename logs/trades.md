### Best Trade of the Week
N/A — no trades.

### Worst Trade of the Week
N/A — no trades.

### What Worked
1. **Infrastructure stood up cleanly** — strategy doc, routine prompts, Alpaca API, memory, and logs are all in place ahead of first trading day.
2. **Macro research framework established** — Fed stance, geopolitics, AI capex theme, sector breadth, earnings calendar, crypto state all captured before deploying capital.
3. **Disciplined dry-run** — resisted the temptation to deploy capital before a defensible thesis. Cash on day one is a feature, not a bug.

### What To Improve
1. **No actual P&L feedback loop yet** — the self-improvement protocol can't trigger until real trades exist; need at least one full trading week to begin pattern recognition.
2. **Need a faster way to pull live quotes** — relying on web search for prices is slow and stale; should integrate the Alpaca market-data endpoint for next routine.
3. **Need a documented setup taxonomy** — so weekly reviews can categorize trades (e.g. "AI-momentum-pullback", "earnings-reaction-fade", "macro-hedge-breakout") and tally win rates per setup type.

### Strategy Adjustments
None. First week — strategy held in original form per CLAUDE.md. Next 4-week evolution checkpoint: 2026-05-29.

### Macro & Market Context Captured
- **Fed (April 29 FOMC):** Held at 3.75%, four dissenters → dovish skew. Market pricing 50bps of cuts in 2026.
- **Geopolitics:** US–Iran peace talks stalled. Strait of Hormuz extended closure → energy supply premium, crypto risk-off.
- **S&P 500:** Near record highs ~7,160. 52-wk range 5,578–7,178. AI capex broadening into financials/healthcare/utilities. 8 of 11 sectors with 2026 EPS growth > 2025.
- **Crypto:** BTC ~$76K, ETH ~$2,250. Three straight days of spot BTC ETF outflows (-$137.77M on 4/29). May historically strongest month for ETH.
- **Earnings cluster (week of 5/4):** PLTR 5/4 AMC · AMD 5/5 AMC · DIS 5/6 BMO · ARM 5/6 AMC.

### Top 10 Watchlist for Week of 2026-05-04

Scoring per CLAUDE.md entry checklist (each criterion 0–2, total /10, minimum 7 to enter):

| # | Ticker | Bucket | Fund | Tech | Cat | Macro | R/R | **Total** | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **TSM** | Long-term | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | **8** | Enter Mon Pre-Market — scale 3% of equity |
| 2 | **GLD** | Long-term hedge | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | **8** | Enter Mon Pre-Market — 3% of equity |
| 3 | **XLE** | Active trading | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | **8** | Tuesday entry if Hormuz still bid; 2.5% of equity |
| 4 | **NVDA** | Long-term | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | **7** | Enter Mon Pre-Market — 3% of equity, prefer pullback |
| 5 | **AVGO** | Long-term | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | **7** | Enter Mon Pre-Market — 3% of equity |
| 6 | **JPM** | Long-term | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | **7** | Enter Mon Pre-Market — 3% of equity |
| 7 | **BTC** | Crypto | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | **7** | Watch for ETF outflows to abate; tactical entry 2–3% on stabilization |
| 8 | **ARM** | Active (post-earnings) | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 0 | **7 pre / re-score post** | DO NOT enter pre-print 5/6; re-evaluate Thursday |
| 9 | **AMD** | Active (post-earnings) | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 0 | **6 pre / re-score post** | DO NOT enter pre-print 5/5; watch reaction Wed |
| 10 | **ETH** | Crypto | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | **6** | Watchlist only; await BTC stabilization first |

**Names explicitly excluded:**
- **PLTR** — earnings 5/4 AMC; consensus calls for plunge, retail-crowded long, asymmetric downside; binary event with no edge.
- **DIS** — earnings 5/6 BMO; no clear thesis edge; will read tape, no pre-position.

### Key Events to Watch (Week of 5/4)
- Mon 5/4 AMC: **PLTR earnings** (read for AI-software demand signal)
- Tue 5/5 AMC: **AMD earnings** (read for AI-accelerator competitive position)
- Wed 5/6 BMO: **DIS earnings**
- Wed 5/6 AMC: **ARM earnings** (read for AI-edge / royalty cadence)
- Ongoing: **Strait of Hormuz status** (drives XLE / oil / risk assets)
- Ongoing: **Spot BTC/ETH ETF flows** (turn from outflow → inflow = green light for crypto bucket)

### Risk Flags
- Indices at record highs — risk/reward compressed at the top of the range; sized first tranches small (3%) to leave dry powder for pullbacks.
- Geopolitical tail risk (Hormuz) — GLD position partially hedges this.
- Crypto in active drawdown — no entries until ETF outflows turn or BTC defends $72K.

### Next Action
Run **Pre-Market routine** Monday 2026-05-04 at 8:00 AM ET. Re-score each watchlist name against fresh tape; place up to 3 MOO orders for highest-conviction long-term names (target: TSM, NVDA, AVGO, JPM, GLD — pick the best 3 on the morning).
