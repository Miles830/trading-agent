## Open Positions (estimated, API blocked — prices from May 14 web research)
| Symbol | Bucket | Qty | Entry | Stop | Target | Cost basis | Est. Price | Est. P/L | Sector |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TSM | long-term | 7 | 401.47 | 353.76 (-12%) | 498.48 (+24%) | $2,810.29 | ~$399.80 | -$11.69 | Semiconductors |
| GLD | active | 7 | 418.86 | 397.92 (-5%) | — | $2,932.02 | ~$429.01 | +$71.05 | Precious metals |
| NVDA | long-term | 15 | 198.83 | 175.60 (-12%) | 247.44 (+24%) | $2,982.45 | ~$235.63 | +$552.00 | Semiconductors |
| JPM | long-term | 9 | 308.30 | 272.14 (-12%) | 383.47 (+24%) | $2,774.72 | ~$300.26 | -$72.36 | Financials |
| XLE | active | 50 | 59.01 | 56.15 (-5%) | 65.01 (+10%) | $2,950.50 | ~$57.64 | -$68.50 | Energy |
| AVGO* | long-term | 11 | 418.59 | 368.36 (-12%) | 519.05 (+24%) | $4,604.49 | ~$422.50 | +$43.01 | Semiconductors |

*AVGO: GTC bracket at $418.59 placed ~May 4. Treating as probable fill (AVGO range May 8 covered $418.59). Stop = bracket OCO child at $368.36 (-12%). Prev close per search = $416.79 (May 13 actual); today estimated ~$422.50.

**Est. total long market value (all 6):** ~$19,568
- TSM: 7 × $399.80 = $2,799
- GLD: 7 × $429.01 = $3,003
- NVDA: 15 × $235.63 = $3,534
- JPM: 9 × $300.26 = $2,702
- XLE: 50 × $57.64 = $2,882
- AVGO: 11 × $422.50 = $4,648

**Net unrealized P/L: +$513.51** (NVDA +$552 is the primary driver; JPM and XLE dragging)

## Sector Exposure (estimated — May 14 EOD)
| Sector | Est. $ | Est. % of equity |
|---|---|---|
| Semiconductors (TSM+NVDA+AVGO) | $10,981 | 10.9% |
| Financials (JPM) | $2,702 | 2.7% |
| Precious metals (GLD) | $3,003 | 3.0% |
| Energy (XLE) | $2,882 | 2.9% |
| Cash | $80,946 | 80.5% |

**After AMD fill (still pending for May 15):**
| Sector | Added $ | New % |
|---|---|---|
| Semiconductors (+AMD 10sh×$445 = $4,450) | $15,431 | 15.4% |
| Cash remaining | $76,496 | 76.1% |

All sectors remain well under 25% cap. After MU + PLTR fills (if entered), semis could approach 20%+ but still below 25% cap.

**LT bucket tech sub-allocation (current):**
TSM+NVDA+AVGO = $10,981 in LT tech; LT total = $10,981 + $2,702 (JPM) = $13,683
LT-tech % = 80.3% → above 60% ceiling BUT LT bucket ($13.7K) < $20K threshold → ceiling is INFORMATIONAL per CLAUDE.md. If PLTR enters ($4,800): LT total = $18,483 → still below $20K, still informational.

## Performance vs S&P 500
- **Portfolio total equity (est.):** ~$100,514
- **Portfolio total return:** +0.51% ($100,514 / $100,000 initial)
- **Today's P&L (vs May 13 est $100,232):** ~+$282 / +0.28% (NVDA +$153 + AVGO +$147 + TSM +$18 + XLE +$14 − JPM $42 − GLD $9)
- **S&P 500 close May 14:** ~7,511 (+0.79%). NEW RECORD HIGH. Dow retook 50,000. Nasdaq at record. Trump-Xi summit Day 1 catalyst.
- **S&P 500 return since strategy start (~May 1):** ~+4.32% (7,511 vs ~7,200 est.)
- **Gap vs SPX:** **-3.81 percentage points** — widened -0.54 pp today (portfolio +0.28% vs SPX +0.79%). Root cause unchanged: 80.5% cash from API blockage.
- **CRITICAL:** Gap approaching -4 pp in 10 trading days. If AMD, PLTR, MU entered tomorrow and markets hold, gap could narrow by ~1 pp. Operator action on May 15 is critical.

## Macro Context (as of 2026-05-14 market close)
- **Trump-Xi Summit Day 1 (TODAY):** Jensen Huang (NVDA CEO) attended with Trump delegation. Xi told US CEOs "China will open wider." H200 chips cleared for select Chinese companies. 200-jet Boeing order confirmed (below 500-jet expectation). No definitive semiconductor export framework yet — Day 2 (May 15, Friday) communiqué pending. Key pending decision: will China fully ease H20/MI308/HBM4 supply chain restrictions?
- **Market reaction to summit:** S&P 500 NEW RECORD HIGH +0.79% to 7,511. Dow retook 50,000. Nasdaq at record. NVDA +4.54% ($235.63 — 6 consecutive up sessions, +15% cumulative). Chip names broadly up. Boeing rallied to $245 intraday on order news before settling on 200-jet vs 500-jet disappointment.
- **PPI context:** April PPI +1.4% (reported May 13). No rate cuts in 2026. But AI/tech narrative overrides macro headwind.
- **NVDA Earnings:** May 21 (7 days). Do NOT enter new NVDA positions after May 19. Existing stop $175.60 provides 34.2% cushion vs $235.63. Pre-earnings review at Daily Review May 19. Consider partial profit-taking or protective hedge if NVDA continues to run.
- **Iran deal:** Still unconfirmed. Oil elevated. XLE stop at $56.15 is thin (2.65% cushion at $57.64). Monitor closely.
- **Bitcoin:** ~$79,600 — dipped below $80K. Summit did not produce crypto language. Re-entry threshold remains $82K+. BTC below $80K is weakness not strength — do not lower threshold.
- **Boeing:** 200-jet China order confirmed but below 500-jet expectations. BA stock volatile ($227-$245 range). Day 2 summit could add maintenance contracts or 2nd-tranche language. Monitor BA for post-summit entry if thesis strengthens.
- **Healthcare leadership:** XLV outperformed (+1.2%) while broader tech mixed. Sector rotation into defensive healthcare occurring alongside tech. Monitor for entry opportunity in specific healthcare names.

## Active Themes
1. **AI broadening / China chip deal** — TSM + NVDA + probable AVGO in LT bucket. AMD approved (7.33), blocked 4 sessions — MUST enter May 15. Summit Day 1 very positive (Jensen Huang attended). Day 2 communiqué could unlock additional chip export easing. MU (memory supercycle, est. 7.33) also pending entry.
2. **Steeper curve / financials drag** — JPM (LT) at $300.26, now -2.6% below entry $308.30. PPI hot = no rate cuts. JPM falling on every high-inflation print. Stop $272.14 provides cushion but thesis weakening. Monitor for stop management.
3. **Geopolitical inflation hedge** — GLD (active) +2.4% from entry ($429.01). XLE thin stop ($56.15 vs $57.64 = 2.65% ⚠️). Iran deal still unconfirmed.
4. **Crypto recovery** — BTC ~$79,600, dipped below $80K. Summit produced no crypto language. Threshold unchanged at $82K. Weakness — do not lower threshold.
5. **Government AI (PLTR AIP)** — PLTR recovering: $133.40 (+2.62% today, just $0.60 from $134 re-entry trigger). Summit Day 2 AI language could be the catalyst. Pre-Market May 15: re-score if PLTR opens >$134.
6. **Aerospace / Boeing** — Boeing 200-jet China order confirmed. GE Aerospace engine supplier. Monitor for entry opportunity if Day 2 summit strengthens the thesis (score ~6.2 currently, needs 7+ for entry).

## Pending Actions — OPERATOR MUST EXECUTE MAY 15

1. **AMD** (score 7.33, breakout-volume, active): Buy 10 shares at open May 15 (MOO or market limit ~$445). Post-fill: place stop at fill_price × 0.95 (active -5%). Target fill × 1.10. This has been approved and blocked/unconfirmed for 4 consecutive sessions. MANDATORY. 4th consecutive instruction.

2. **PLTR** (score 6.50, CONDITIONAL): Re-enter ONLY if PLTR opens and holds above $134 on May 15 summit Day 2 news. Full 6-agent re-score at Pre-Market. Estimated re-score: 7.33 if Technical rises to 6 on support reclaim.

3. **MU** (Micron, est. score ~7.33, ai-momentum-pullback, LT): Full 6-agent score at Pre-Market May 15. AI memory supercycle; JEDEC HBM4; May 12 pullback gives better entry at ~$788. LT entry: stop -12% = $693, target +24% = $977. Run full framework before placing.

4. **NVDA May 21 earnings:** Pre-earnings review at Daily Review May 19. No new NVDA entries after May 19. Existing stop $175.60 provides 34.2% cushion. Consider partial profit-taking or protective strategy if NVDA continues rallying (now at $235.63, +18.5% above entry).

5. **AVGO:** Still unconfirmed via API. Treating as probable fill at $418.59. Current price ~$422.50 (+0.9% above entry — recovering). If NOT filled, operator should verify account.

## Pending Deferrals (≥7 watchlist names not yet entered)
- **AMD** (7.33) — 4th consecutive deployment failure; operator must place at market open May 15
- **MU** (est. 7.33) — pending full 6-agent score at Pre-Market May 15
- **PLTR** (conditional 7.33) — re-enter if $134 reclaimed on Day 2 summit news

## Lessons Learned (running log)
- **Week of 2026-04-27 (init):** No trades placed. First-run setup; benchmarking begins next week.
- **2026-05-01 — bias correction (operator-mandated):** Capital in cash earns nothing. Score ≥ 7 = enter at next routine. Only 3 valid skip exemptions per CLAUDE.md Deployment Bias.
- **2026-05-04 — remote-routine failure mode discovered:** Cron triggers produced zero commits/orders. Manual session broke the streak.
- **2026-05-05 — silent failure REPEATS:** Heartbeat infra not sufficient. Operator pre-queued brackets saved the day (NVDA, JPM filled). GLD naked stop discovered and fixed.
- **2026-05-06 — API blocked (new failure mode):** Routine ran late AND Alpaca API blocked. AMD, PLTR, BTC documented as attempts; none executed.
- **2026-05-08 — API blocked AGAIN (3rd consecutive):** AMD and PLTR MOO blocked at 12:19Z. HTTP 403 from Anthropic TLS proxy. Persistent infrastructure problem.
- **2026-05-08 to 2026-05-12 (weekend gap):** S&P 500 hit record 7,412.84 on May 11 while portfolio remained 80% cash. Gap cost: ~2.1-2.7 percentage points vs. benchmark.
- **2026-05-12 — CPI binary event note:** April CPI is NOT a CLAUDE.md-exempt binary event. MOO orders must be placed regardless; CPI price reflection happens at open.
- **2026-05-12 — AMD setup change:** AMD entry thesis changed from `earnings-reaction-follow` (at $413) to `breakout-volume` (at $466) due to China chip deal catalyst. Scores valid at 7.33. Technical 5 due to elevated RSI.
- **2026-05-13 — PPI shock:** April PPI +1.4% vs +0.5% expected — largest since 2022. S&P rose +0.69% anyway (tech-led). Lesson: macro data shocks can be absorbed by strong sector narratives (AI/tech). PPI is NOT a CLAUDE.md-exempt binary event — same as CPI.
- **2026-05-13 — PLTR support break:** PLTR fell -4.31% to $129.99, breaking $134 support zone. Re-score: 6.50 (Technical dropped to 3). Correct response: re-score and skip — not force-entry into broken technical setup. Will re-enter when $134 reclaimed.
- **2026-05-13 — AMD pullback (thesis intact):** AMD declined from $477 peak to $448.29. Re-score: 7.33 (Technical improved from 5 to 6 as RSI normalized). Remains a MUST-ENTER. 7th consecutive API blockage.
- **2026-05-14 — Trump-Xi Summit Day 1:** Jensen Huang attended. NVDA +4.54% on H200 clearance for select Chinese companies. 200-jet Boeing order confirmed (below 500-jet). Markets hit all-time records (S&P, Nasdaq, Dow 50K). PLTR recovered +2.62% to $133.40 — nearly at $134 re-entry trigger. JPM fell -1.52% despite record market (financials soft on no-cut rates thesis). Lesson: high-inflation environment benefits AI/tech names but hurts financials even on up-market days.
- **2026-05-14 — 8th consecutive API blockage, 6 more silent routine failures:** AMD entry now 4 consecutive deployment failures. Cumulative benchmark gap: -3.81 pp. Intraday routine scheduler not firing. Two separate infrastructure problems: (1) API allowlist not patched; (2) cron/scheduler not firing intraday sessions.
- **NVDA earnings risk:** NVDA reports Q2 on May 21 (7 days). Pre-earnings review MUST happen at Daily Review May 19. Stop $175.60 provides 34.2% cushion vs $235.63. Consider partial profit-taking or collar if NVDA above $240 on May 19.

## Strategy Evolution Notes
- **2026-05-01 (init):** Strategy initialized per CLAUDE.md. No deviations.
- **2026-05-04:** First positions opened. Strategy unchanged; execution layer needs fixing.
- **2026-05-08:** Three-week persistent API blockage causing compounding execution gaps. Portfolio 85% cash vs. 10% floor target.
- **2026-05-12:** China chip deal changes AMD thesis from earnings-follow to breakout-volume. Rate-cut thesis broken (no cuts until 2027) but partially offset by China chip deal sector tailwind. PLTR government AI revenues insulated from rate environment. NVDA May 21 earnings approaching.
- **2026-05-14 (Week 2 Thursday):** Trump-Xi Summit Day 1 delivered massive NVDA catalyst (+4.54%). Boeing 200-jet order confirmed. PLTR near $134 re-entry. Markets at all-time records. Portfolio at +0.51% vs S&P +4.32% — entire gap attributable to API blockage keeping portfolio 80% in cash. No strategy changes warranted; execution infrastructure is the only problem. If API fixed and AMD/PLTR/MU deployed, portfolio would be ~+4-5% aligned with benchmark. **Friday Weekly Evolution Note:** Full strategy evolution note to be written at Daily Review May 15 (Friday).

## Next Routine Plan
- **Pre-Market May 15 (8:00 AM ET — FRIDAY, Summit Day 2):** 
  1. **AMD MOO 10 shares** — score 7.33, MANDATORY (4th instruction). If API blocked: operator places manually before 9:25 AM ET. 
  2. **PLTR re-score** — if opens >$134: run full 6-agent framework, est. score 7.33. Enter 36sh at market open with LT stop -12%.
  3. **MU full 6-agent score** — AI memory supercycle; est. score 7.33. Entry ~$788, stop -12% $693, target +24% $977. 10sh = $7,880 = 7.8% > 5% cap → reduce to 6sh = $4,728 = 4.7% ✓.
  4. **Trump-Xi Day 2 communiqué** — read final semiconductor language before placing orders. Adjust chip name scores accordingly.
  5. **Stop audit** — verify all 6 existing stops still resting (assumed GTC from May 4-6 bracket placements).
- **Market Open (9:45 AM ET):** Post-MOO stops for AMD (and PLTR/MU if entered). Verify fills.
- **Daily Review May 15 (4:30 PM ET — FRIDAY):** Weekly strategy evolution note. NVDA pre-earnings prep begins (6 days to May 21).

## Cash Reserve Floor
$10,000 (10%). Current cash $80,946 — $70,946 available to deploy before hitting floor.
AMD fills would consume: 10sh × $445 = $4,450 → remaining: $76,496
+ PLTR 36sh × $134 = $4,824 → remaining: $71,672
+ MU 6sh × $788 = $4,728 → remaining: $66,944
After all three: $66,944 still in cash = 66% — still massively above 10% floor.
NVDA pre-earnings hedge consideration: Could use up to 1% of portfolio = ~$1,000 in protective puts.
